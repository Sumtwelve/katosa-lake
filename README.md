# Katosa Lake
An interactive fantasy novel where the future isn't the only thing affected by your choices.

You play as Joshua, an unassuming human who finds himself in a strange place and must make decisions to survive it.

This project was originally written in 2021, entirely in Python. Now that I've learned JavaScript, I want to move the game from the command line to the web so anyone can play it without having to install Python. This will take a bit of work but I think the game deserves some publicity. I spent a lot of time on it.

## TO DO

- Adapt Python code into JS
- Create better response-handling system. It's all ifs and elses right now and it's rather unwieldy. Maybe look for a good NPM package (or write one yourself)
- Revise the writing
- Write another story branch
- Create the front end
- Deploy
